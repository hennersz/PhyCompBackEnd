# PhyCompBackEnd

##Installation
Requires node and npm to be installed

To install the node dependancies run.
```
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
```

then start the app with `npm start` or `npm debug` to run with debugging messages

This will need a mongo database running as described below.

##Database
We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) for the database. When running the app as development or test you will need to have a database running locally. Once you have mongo installed run it with `mongod`. If you wish to use a database that isn't running on the default port or isn't running locally change the URI in \_config which is described below.

##_config.js
This config file is used to specify the database URIs for development, testing and production. It will look something like this: 
``` javascript
var config = {};

config.mongoURI = {
  development: 'localhost:27017/pollution',
  test: 'localhost:27017/test-data',
  production: process.env.DBUSER + ':' + process.env.DBPASS + '@ds055945.mlab.com:55945/pollution'
};

module.exports = config;
```
In our example we store the credentials for the production database as environment variables on the machine the app is running on.

it is then called in app.js in a similar way to here:
``` javascript
var config = require('./_config');
var monk = require('monk');
var db = monk(config.mongoURI[app.get('env')]);
```


##API docs
To generate the API docs first you have to install [apidocsjs](http://apidocjs.com)

`npm install -g apidocs`

Then run `apidocs -i routes/ -o public/Docs` to generate the files needed. This takes routes as the input directory and public/Docs as the output directory. 

##Testing
Unit testing is done using [Mochajs](http://mochajs.org) which you can install with `npm install -g mocha`
We also make use of [chaijs](http://chaijs.com) and the chaihttp plugin but these will be installed as dependencies.

To run the tests use `mocha`
Mocha will run all files in the test directory.

```
The main file for the app is app.js this is where most other files ultimately connect into. The middleware for handling requests and dealing with errors is defined here as well as the periodic connection to the external APIs. 

The public directory contains all the static files that are needed. This is not really used much apart from a couple of files and the Docs directory where all the files generated by apidocs.js are stored

The routes Directory contains all the express routing code.

Views containes all the [jade](http://jade-lang.com) files for the views. Each view inherits from layout.jade which contains some features that are common to all other views.
